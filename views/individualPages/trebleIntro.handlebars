<h2 class="newLessonHeader">Welcome to the Treble Clef!</h2>
<p class="lessonDescription">
    A clef appears at the beginning of every line of music and tells
    the musician how to read their music. Notes will appear on spaces
    and lines of the staff, but depending on the clef, these notes
    will mean different things.

                This is what a treble clef looks like.
                It is also called the G clef because the heart
                of the clef surrounds the note we call a G.
            </p>
            <p>The spaces on the treble clef spell FACE, reading from bottom to top.</p>
            <p>The lines on the treble clef stand for Every Good Boy Does Fine, reading from bottom to top.</p>
