                This is what a bass clef looks like.
                It is also called the F clef because the two
                dots on the left side surround the F line.</p>
            <p>The spaces on the bass clef stand for All Cows Eat Grass, reading from bottom to top.</p>
            <p>The lines on the bass clef stand for Good Boys Deserve Fudge Always, reading from bottom to top.</p>
